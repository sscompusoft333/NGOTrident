                                  <strong> World Humanitarians Foundation</strong>  focuses on Arts and Culture, Education and Woman Empowerment. World Humanitarians Foundation promotes art and culture via events with artists to share their talents worldwide. WHF focused on promoting Art, Culture and Tourism through the Exhibition and Fashion show because we believe that an art walk is a great way to direct people through your country and encourage the world to visit different areas of India. Unity in diversity is one of the major characteristics of Indian culture which makes it unique. Culture includes the elements that characterise a particular people’s way of life. The arts-vast subdivision of culture is composed of many creative endeavours and disciplines.                                </p>

                                  Education is one of the most potential and sustainable ways to put an end to illiteracy and poverty. Education not only empowers the student but also makes a positive shift for the whole family. With education, people can achieve their aspirations and grow up to be self-dependent and resourceful citizens.                                </p>

                                Women's Empowerment can be deﬁned as promoting women's sense of self-worth, their ability to determine their own choices, and their right to inﬂuence social change for themselves and others. Women. Empowerment Summit 2023 is a collective effort by WHF to provide women of the community with a secure space to ask questions, engage with industry experts, and receive encouragement and motivation to pursue success in the transitions they face. However, women's empowerment now can be categorized into ﬁve main parts – social, educational, economic, political and psychological. Our event's engaging activities are designed to build leadership skills, inspire personal action, and expand your vision of a welcoming, safe, and supportive community for all. Women's empowerment may be deﬁned in several ways, including accepting women's viewpoints, making an effort to seek them and raising the status of women through education, awareness, literacy, and training.
